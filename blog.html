        <p class="text-2xl">
            Map - The map method receives a function as a parameter. Then it applies it on each element of the array and returns an entirely new array populated with the results of calling the provided function. In short, The map() method is used to transform the elements of an array. <br>
            <br>
            forEach - forEach method receives a function as an argument and executes it once for each array element. It calls a function for each element in an array. Its a powerful method used to modify and interact with data collections. <br>
            <br>
            Filter - Filter method check every elements of an array and then return a new array containing all the matching elements that pass the conditions/test. <br>
